<p>A typical Couch Potato component might look something like this:
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
define(['app', 'lodash', 'myService', function(app, _) {

  app.registerController('myController', ['$scope', '$timeout', '$myService',

    function($scope, $timeout, $myService) {

      $scope.concattedAlphas = '';
      _.each(['a', 'b', 'c'], function(val) {
        $scope.concattedAlphas += val;
      });

      $timeout(
        function() {
          $scope.aValueFromMyService = $myService.aValue;
        },
        1000
      );
    }
  ]);
});
</pre>

<p>That really silly controller depends on the AMD modules "lodash" and
"myService".</p>

<p>lodash is just the lodash utility library.  It knows nothing
about Couch Potato (or Angular) and doesn't need to.  This is regular RequireJS here.</p>

<p>On the other hand, "myService" is itself (or at least might be) a Couch Potato AMD module.  It is
defined similarly to the one we're defining here (i.e.
app.registerService(...)).  Note the use of the word "might".  It's also
entirely possible that myService was configured as a non-lazy component.  In
fact, when you use Couch Potato and you define components as modules like the
one above, you are in control of whether they end up being loaded lazily or
built into your application as part of a RequireJS compilation/minification
build step (e.g in a grunt task).</p>

<p>Both modules are required as part of requiring myController.  In practical
terms, this means that:</p>

<ul>
<li>lodash can be used within the controller; and</li>
<li>myService will be registered before anyone tries to use myController, thus
it can be injected into myController.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this way, Couch Potato components can depend on each other.  This follows
the "AMD way" of expressing dependencies, so that users of myController (e.g.
routes or states) are not forced to know what components the controller requires
 -- the controller module is tracking that,
and RequireJS is ensuring that everything it needs is prepped and ready to go.</p>

<p>You may have noticed that we have not discussed the "app" dependency.  It's the
application module.  It deserves some discussion.</p>

<p>These AMD modules run outside the context of Angular.  There needs to be a way
to tie back into your app in order to register the component with Angular.  The
application module is the bridge.</p>

<p>It turns out that in order to make it possible for Couch Potato to do its work,
we've prepared the application module with some sugary functions that expose
the Couch Potato services.  Later, we'll see what those sugary functions look
like.  For now, just know that app.registerController is a function that's using
Couch Potato to get the controller registered.</p>

<p>The rest of the code in this module is just standard Angular stuff.  The only
real difference is the define function that wraps it and the call
to app.registerController instead of app.controller.</p>

<p>Ok, with components out of the way, let's loop back and look at the app module
again to understand how it's enabling this app.registerController business.
