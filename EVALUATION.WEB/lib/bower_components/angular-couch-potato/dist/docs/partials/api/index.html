<p>You can use the navbar on the left to search (see footnote), or
click an item from the table of contents.</p>

<p>If you're looking for an overview of Couch Potato or want to know how to
get started, try the <a href="#/guide">guide</a>.</p>

<p><em>Footnote: Well, you <strong>should</strong> be able to use the search, but it's broken in this version of Angular docs -- you can't (usefully) click on the results it finds :(</em></p></div>
