<p>Couch Potato aids in the lazy download and and run-time registration of:</p>

<ul>
<li>controllers</li>
<li>factories</li>
<li>directives</li>
<li>values</li>
<li>filters</li>
<li>decorators</li>
</ul>

<p>It supports hierarchies of dependencies within these components, expressed as
<a href="http://requirejs.org/" target="_blank">RequireJS</a> modules.  Applications can use Couch Potato to download and register components when they are needed to satisfy the requirements of a given <em>route</em>, or can do so ad-hoc in response to other application events.</p>

<p><em>For the impatient, the hasty and the quick, you can stop reading and take a look at the
<a href="samples/" target="_blank">samples</a> or check out their <a href="https://github.com/stu-salsbury/angular-couch-potato/samples" target="_blank">source code</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>For the reference learner, you can dive straight into the <a href="#/api">API</a>.</em></p>

<h3 id="thisguidecontainsseveralsections">This guide contains several sections:</h4>

<p>The <a href="#/guide/05-conceptual">Conceptual Overview</a> section explains the purpose(s) for which
Couch Potato is intended and how its usage differs from traditional AngularJS
component definition and registration.</p>

<p><a href="#/guide/11-architecture">Architecture using Couch Potato</a> describes how applications and their components are organized and authored in a Couch Potato context.</p>

<p><a href="#/guide/21-lazy-loading-via-routing">Lazy Loading Via Routing</a> introduces the most common use case for Couch Potato -- loading and registering components in the context of route/state changes in the application.</p>

<p><a href="#/guide/31-lazy-loading-ad-hoc">Ad Hoc Lazy Loading</a> demonstrates how arbitrary application code can invoke the download and registration of Couch Potato components.</p>

<p><a href="#/guide/41-thoughts">Thoughts on Lazy Loading</a> is a sort of postlude in which some challenges and ideas for the future are presented, hopefully in a manner that is somewhat more organized than a ramble.</p>

<h4 id="ofcoursethereisaahrefguide03faqfaqapage">Of course, there is a <a href="#/guide/03-faq">FAQ</a> page.</h5>

<h2 id="blahblah">blah blah</h3>

<p>describes how applications and their components are organized and authored in a Couch Potato context.</p>

<p>The various "use case" sections show how Couch Potato can be used in several
contexts:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#/guide/20a-with-ngRoute">Use with ngRoute</a> demonstrates how Couch Potato can
be configured to load components when a particular <strong>route</strong> is activated during
a user's interaction with an application;</li>
<li><a href="#/guide/20b-with-resolve">Use with resolve</a> demonstrates how
Couch Potato can be configured to load <em>individual</em> components when a particular
<strong>ui-router state</strong> is acvtivated;</li>
<li><a href="#/guide/20c-with-ui-templateProvider">Use with templateProvider</a> demonstrates how Couch Potato can be configured to load a <em>set of components
along with a template</em> when a particular <strong>ui-router view</strong> is activated;</li>
<li><a href="#/guide/20d-ad-hoc">Use Ad Hoc</a> demonstrates how Couch Potato can be called
within application code that is outside the scope of any router.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, some <a href="#/guide/90-closing-thoughts">closing thoughts</a> are presented with the
hope of stimulating discussion and interest in participating in Couch Potato
specifically and the development of tools and techniques for building big
applications/sites with AngularJS in general.</p></div>
