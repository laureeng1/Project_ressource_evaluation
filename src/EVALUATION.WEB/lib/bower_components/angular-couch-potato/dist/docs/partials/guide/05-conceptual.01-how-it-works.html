<h4 id="ingeneral">In General</h5>

<p>Couch Potato works by preparing itself -- at configuration-time to do -- at
run-time -- the work of registering components.</p>

<p>In a normal AngularJS application, when run-time starts (which is typically
when module.run happens or when the application is bootstrapped), all providers
become "uninjectable."  As such, you lose the ability to configure components.</p>

<p>By storing references to the key registration "vehicles", Couch Potato can perform
registrations during run-time.  The components Couch Potato maintains references
to are:</p>

<ul>
<li>$controllerProvider,</li>
<li>$compileProvider,</li>
<li>$provide,</li>
<li>$filterProvider</li>
</ul>

<p>Lazy-registration would be of little use if you couldn't lazily <em>load</em> script.</p>

<p>This is where AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) comes in.  Couch Potato uses <a href="requirejs.org" target="_blank">RequireJS</a>.  If you are unfamiliar with
RequireJS, you'll want to read up a little.  The general idea is that an AMD
module definition states a list of dependencies and then specifies its
definition.</p>

<p>When a module is requested ("required" in AMD terms), all of it dependencies
are fetched (or retrieved from the cache if they've already been required), and
then passed to the module as function parameters.  Continue by reading about
<a href="#/guide/17-couch-potato-components">Couch Potato Components</a>.</p>

<p>This guide is about to get heavy.  If you haven't already done so, it's highly
recommended that you stop and <a href="samples">look at the samples</a>
before you proceed.</p></div>
